Description: Read me for concordia.matchtool
        =====================
        
        concordia.matchtool is a framework for defining and executing rulesets to
        effect matching of records in two datasets. The original use case is getting
        matches between print-style BAtlas citations held in the IAph2007
        inscriptions collection and Barrington Atlas IDs. Another early use case
        is matching content extracted from the Barrington Atlas Directory
        compilation files against feature data digitized from Barrington Atlas
        compilation maps.

        Tests
        ===
        
        To run tests, cd into the top-level package directory (idp.contenttool) and type:
        
        %% python setup.py test
        
        
        Components and using them
        ===================
        
        Most modules and functions have docstrings, which explain their constituent
        classes and methods. This information is not repeated here in order to avoid the
        dreaded multiple-source documentation disease.
        
        The tests are a good way to learn how the different components work.
        
        You can view a formatted version of the docstrings, plus additional information
        automatically gathered about subordinate and inherited classes and methods,
        using the python built-in help() function, for example:
        
        >>> import concordia.matchtool.match as m
        >>> help(m)
        
        concordia/matchtool/rules.py defines classes for building, managing and executing rulesets
        
        concordia/matchtool/dset.py defines classes for managing datasets to be related (would/could build parsers to read data in various formats
        into this internal data structure, which rules.py then knows how to do stuff with)
        
        concordia/matchtool/data.cfg provides configuration information (like relative or absolute paths to data files)
        
        concordia/matchtool/tests/rule.txt contains some explanatory tests for the classes and methods in concordia/matchtool/rules.py
